# Carnival Duck Shooter
A fun, fast-paced carnival-style mini-game built in Python using **Pygame**! Aim, shoot, and score points by hitting moving ducks before time or shots run out.

 # Gameplay Overview
In this game, players control a crosshair and shoot at ducks moving in opposite directions on two rows. Each duck has a randomized point value â€” some are even worth zero! Can you hit the high-scoring ducks before you run out of shots or time?
